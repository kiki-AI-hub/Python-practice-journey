# Healthcare Projects

This folder is dedicated to projects, research notes, and experiments related to healthcare technology.  
My goal is to explore and develop solutions using Python, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Machine Learning (ML) to address real-world medical challenges and improve patient care.  

Here I will document:
- Project ideas and proposals
- Research papers and resources
- Code samples and prototypes
- Challenges faced and learnings

This folder reflects my long-term vision to build impactful healthcare applications and contribute to the field of technology-driven medical solutions.
